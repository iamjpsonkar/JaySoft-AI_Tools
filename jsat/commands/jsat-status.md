description: Show JSAT index statistics and health.

Use jsat__get_index_status and jsat__get_jsat_version to display:
- Node and edge counts with breakdown by type
- JSAT version and graph backend (SQLite / Neo4j)
- Index freshness (when last indexed)

Flag if: node count is 0 (not indexed yet), or version is outdated.
Suggest /jsat-index . if graph is empty.


BUDGET: Universal flags for every command (strip from ARGS, pass as tool args):
  timeout=<N>     → override soft budget to N seconds (default varies per tool)
  dashboard=true  → open a real-time browser dashboard for this call (closes 10s after done)
                    Example: /jsat crack dashboard=true timeout=300 redesign the auth flow
                             → jsat__crack(task='...', _budget=300, _dashboard=True)
  ⏱ progress notification = still running (wait, skip, or split — AI decides)
  ⏱ _slow in response = completed after budget (result is valid)
  ⛔ _hard_timeout in response = force-killed at 5× budget (retry with narrower scope)

HOW TO RESPOND: Actually invoke the tool(s) described above, then reply with a direct, useful answer built from the result — interpret it for the user in plain language. Do not merely describe what the tool does, and do not echo raw JSON. If a tool returns an intermediate artifact (e.g. an optimized prompt), use it to finish the task rather than presenting it as the final answer.
